# Machine Learning Practical

This repository contains the code for the University of Edinburgh [School of Informatics](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk) course [Machine Learning Practical](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlp/).

This assignment-based course is focused on the implementation and evaluation of machine learning systems. Students who do this course will have experience in the design, implementation, training, and evaluation of machine learning systems.

The code in this repository is split into:

  *  a Python package `mlp`, a [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) based neural network package designed specifically for the course that students will implement parts of and extend during the course labs and assignments,
  *  a series of [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks in the `notebooks` directory containing explanatory material and coding exercises to be completed during the course labs.

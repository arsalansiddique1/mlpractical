# Machine Learning Practical

This repository contains the code for the University of Edinburgh [School of Informatics](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk) course [Machine Learning Practical](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/mlp/).

This assignment-based course is focused on the implementation and evaluation of machine learning systems. Students who do this course will have experience in the design, implementation, training, and evaluation of machine learning systems.

The code in this repository is split into:

  *  a Python package `mlp`, a [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) based neural network package designed specifically for the course that students will implement parts of and extend during the course labs and assignments,
  *  a series of [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks in the `notebooks` directory containing explanatory material and coding exercises to be completed during the course labs.

## Coursework 2
The aim of the report for this coursework will be to explore the Vanishing Gradient problem on image classification with the CIFAR100 dataset and using Convolutional Neural Networks.

* This coursework provides you with the ability to set up your experiments on Google Cloud (as you will need to work on a GPU), and an email with instructions on how to claim $50 of credits for will circulate on the coursework release day.
* The coursework requires you to work with Pytorch, with instructions and code support that should make it easy to get started, involving few lines of code.

Among other things, this coursework aims to expose you to the process of writing a Machine Learning paper, without having you plan out and write a complete report. Instead, we are providing you with a template document that has significant parts of a report for the task filled in for you. A set of questions is provided, and your answers to those is automatically added to the template to form a complete paper. This time we do not look into Abstract and Introduction, but focus more on the description of proposed solutions, experiments, and future work.
The first part of this coursework concerns the identification of the vanishing gradient problem. You will then proceed to explain two proposed solutions in terms of how they work and how they might help with our problem. You will implement two networks making use of these techniques and add your results to a largely pre-filled Table (this way you can discuss the results even if you have not managed to get your code working). Lastly, you will summarise and conclude the report, while also providing suggestions for future work.
Full details are provided in the attached coursework specification, including how to get the related files and templates from the course's Github repository.
